# Training Details
1. Python3 needs to be in your path for the HUD to work. You can launch it manuall by simply calling 'python utils.py'
2. All files referenced in the game's code are relative so you have to 'cd' into the directory where the game files are located.
3. The game was written quickly on Windows so there may be some assumptions that are based on the game running on a Windows system.
